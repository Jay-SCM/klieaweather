Weather App
Overview
The Weather App is a React-based application that allows users to get the current weather information for a specified location. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and the Unsplash API to fetch a relevant background image based on the weather conditions. The app provides a simple interface for users to input their country, state, city, and zip code to retrieve the weather information.
